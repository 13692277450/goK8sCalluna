# goK8sCalluna
K8s management tool build by Golang, I plan build a excellent K8s management tool in the next two year, pls kindly support me! Thanks.

Now, it can get Pods info, resources info, log info, deploy pod..., I will continue update.

Pods information:

Resources information:

Use method:

copy config from .kube in K8s server folder, past content to kubeconfig in kubernetsServ folder, setup a database in mysql server and 
create username password colums. then you can get K8s server information. deploy pod function is work fine now, just put yaml info into 
deployment.yaml in kubernetsServ folder.
